water boils at one hundred
the sun is a star
earth revolves around the sun
light travels faster than sound
honey never spoils or expires
sharks existed before trees appeared
ants can lift fifty times
venus is planet closest sun
octopuses have three separate hearts
cats sleep for fourteen hours
bananas are technically a berry
a group of crows murder
frogs absorb water through skin
butterflies taste food with feet
penguins mate for life often
mount everest tallest mountain earth
